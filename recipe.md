DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°. In a small food processor, blend blueberries until no large chunks remain.

2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add blueberry puree, sugar, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer until slightly reduced, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. 

3. To make crust: In a large bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar, until mixture resembles wet sand. Press into bottom and up sides of an 8" or 9" springform pan. 

4. To make cheesecake: In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), beat cream cheese and sugar until no lumps remain. Add eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla and sour cream. Add flour and salt and beat until just combined. Fold in the blueberry puree. 

5. Pour mixture over crust. Wrap bottom of pan in aluminum foil and place in a large roasting pan. Pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the baking pan. 

6. Bake until center of cheesecake only slightly jiggles, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn off heat, prop open oven door, and let cheesecake cool in oven, 1 hour.

7. Remove foil and refrigerate cheesecake until completely chilled, at least 5 hours and up to overnight.

8. When ready to serve, top cheesecake with whipped cream, blueberries and chocolate syrup.

9. Your blueberry cheesecake is ready to be served and eaten. Enjoy the berrytastic treat!
